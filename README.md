# neovim-setup
My preferred neovim setup

This is my neovim setup on ubuntu-based linux distros.
It contains:
  * vimrc
  * tmux.conf
  * setup.sh script to install software and clone necessary plugin repos including vim-plug and YouCompleteMe

Simply clone this repo and run ./setup.sh to run with my neovim configuration.
