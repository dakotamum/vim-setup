# vim-setup
My preferred vim setup

This is my vim setup on ubuntu-based linux distros.
It contains:
  * vimrc
  * tmux.conf
  * setup.sh script to install software and clone necessary plugin repos including vundle and YouCompleteMe

Simply clone this repo and run ./setup.sh to run with my vim configuration.
